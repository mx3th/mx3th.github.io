## Gameplay breakdown

In this article I'm going to be doing a gameplay breakdown of the recent Street Fighter 6 developer match.
I'm going to be covering everything in the order of the match so let's begin!

### Manon Target Combo

The round starts with Marisa whiffing her st.MK and Manon using her st.HP target combo to land a punish.
Manon's target combo has a unique trait of pulling the opponent closer to her (within throw range), which allows her to continue pressuring after or go for a mixup.

This is a very strong situation for a grappler, and it's great to see a reward for playing a strong ground game. In this instance Manon decided to go for a regular throw, 
which is the safest option in this situation. If she were to try and land one of her unblockable command throw's, she could face a full punish if Marisa were to jump here.
By going for a regular throw, Manon would recover in time to punish a potential jump out from Marisa.

### Manon Crouching Heavy Kick

Next up we see Manon's cr.HK. She shows off her ballet roots her with an elegant forward sliding attack!
This sweeep is double hitting and has a ton of range, there is no doubt that this move will be punishable on block, but clearly it's good enough to catch people off guard.

Manon tries to go for a Drive Rush afterwards but is too far to continue any significant pressure.

### Marisa Drive Impact Combo

Good lord the damage. Capcom did an insane job on the animations for both these characters, but Marisa's attacks feel so impactful!

### Marisa Armoured Attack

Marisa follows up her Drive Rush with what appears to be a forward advancing armoured attack / parry.
She hits straight through Manon's st.LP here, putting her into Stun & Burnout, then finishing the round with a guaranteed command throw.
